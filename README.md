# Real Estate Dataset Exploration

## Overview

This repository contains code and data for analyzing a real estate dataset. The dataset includes information about house prices, house age, distance to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores, latitude, and longitude. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the analysis code.

## Dataset
#### Real Estate Valuation Dataset

The Real Estate Valuation dataset used in this project was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real+estate+valuation+data+set). The dataset was originally contributed by Prof. I-Cheng Yeh of the Department of Civil Engineering at National Taiwan University.
The dataset used in this analysis can be found in the file `Realstate_dataset.xlsx`.

## Analysis Steps

The analysis includes the following steps:

### Data Loading

Load the dataset:

### Data Inspection

Inspect the dataset to understand its structure and check for missing values.

### Data Cleaning

Clean the data by handling missing values and removing duplicates.

### Feature Understanding

Examine the features and their data types.

### Univariate Analysis

Perform univariate analysis to explore individual features.

### Bivariate Analysis

Conduct bivariate analysis to investigate relationships between pairs of features.

### Multivariate Analysis

Perform multivariate analysis to understand the behavior of features.

## Requirements

To run the analysis code, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the analysis:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zekarias4242/real_estate.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd real_estate
    ```


3. **Run the analysis script**:

    Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform the analysis:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook data_expl.ipynb
    ```

    Replace 'data_expl.ipynb' with the name of the notebook or script containing the code.

4. **Explore the analysis**:

    Open the Jupyter Notebook or review the script to explore the analysis results and visualizations.

Now you can easily set up and run the analysis on your local machine.
